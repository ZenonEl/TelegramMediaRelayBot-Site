# 🌌 Introduction

### 🚀 Welcome to the documentation of **TelegramMediaRelayBot** — your digital assistant for working with media!

**TelegramMediaRelayBot** is not just a bot, but a multifunctional tool that turns Telegram into a powerful hub for handling media content.  
Using the **yt-dlp** core (with the prospect of integrating **gallery-dl**), the bot skillfully downloads videos and images from 50+ platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, while its intelligent forwarding system makes sharing content incredibly easy.  

Imagine: you send a link → the bot instantly downloads the file → automatically forwards it to the right people.  
All this — with customizable privacy through Tor and full control over your data.

### 🛡️ Advanced Proxy and Tor Support
- **Proxy support**
  Stay anonymous and maintain privacy, even when exchanging videos of cute cats :)
- **Tor integration**:  
  Tor can be very useful if a site suspects you're a bot or thinks you're sending too many requests to it, and to solve this, sometimes all you need is a simple IP change.
- **Tor Control**:  
  Configure IP rotation at intervals, and sites won't realize that it's you again, just under a different guise.
