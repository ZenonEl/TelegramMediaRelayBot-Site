# 🌌 Introduction

:::tip
*Guide is focused on version v0.3.0-beta Cosmic Cuckoo*
:::

### 🚀 Welcome to the documentation of **TelegramMediaRelayBot**, your digital media assistant!

**Problem:**
You found cool content, but:
- friends aren't registered on a platform (like TikTok or Reddit) 
- are too lazy to click on links and watch 
- don't want to bother saving files or registering on a new platform 

You have to download, forward the same thing manually to everyone and clean up your device's memory. Does this sound like hell? This is exactly why I created the bot.

**TelegramMediaRelayBot** is not just a bot, but a multifunctional tool that turns Telegram into a powerful media content hub.  
Using **yt-dlp** (with **gallery-dl** integration if you so desire), the bot masterfully downloads media content and images from 50+ platforms, including YouTube, Reddit, and TikTok, and a convenient forwarding system makes sharing content incredibly easy.  

How does it work?
1. You: Throw the bot a link (+ newline description if needed) 
2. Bot: Downloads the content → Forwards it to your contacts based on your settings 
3. You: Enjoy life and a new portion of automation in it 

All this - with customizable privacy via Tor (or other proxy) and full control over the data.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎬 Universal Media Downloading
- **Supports multiple platforms**: YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, Pinterest and more.
- **Wide features**: yt-dlp and gallery-dl with the ability to customize formats and quality via config.
- **Group work**: supports Telegram group chats. Send a link, the bot will download content and send it to the group and other smaller features.
- **Future Plans**: Improving existing features and adding new features.

### 🤖 Automated Forwarding
- **Automation**: 
  Customize how the bot handles links (e.g.: "If I haven't changed my mind in 5 seconds - download and share content according to my rules")
- **Comfortable Recipient Lists**: 
  Add contacts (which can be grouped together) via the bot menu.
- **Hashtags and tags**:  
  `#family`, `#work` — sort content and simplify search in chat history using custom hashtags or built-in ones.
- **Use case scenario**:  
  _«Need to send a video to colleagues → The bot automatically downloads and forwards it to the work chat with your specified hashtag #meeting»._

### 🛡️ Advanced Proxy Support, Including Tor
- **Proxy support**
  Stay anonymous and maintain confidentiality, even when exchanging funny cat videos :)
- **Tor integration**:  
  Tor can be very useful if a site suspects that a bot is accessing it instead of a real person or if it thinks you're sending too many requests. To solve this, sometimes all you need is a simple IP change.
- **Tor Control**:  
  Configure IP rotation at set intervals, and sites won't realize it's you again, just under a different guise.

Why you'll love it? ❤️
- Free and Open Source: The project is for personal use, not for profit. No hidden code or subscriptions 
- Flexibility: Even without contacts - use it as your personal cloud in Telegram. Add hashtags to your files (#memes, #gifs) to easily find them. 
- Simplicity: You don't need supernatural effort to get started. Just take a little time to customize and you're good to go. Don't forget to invite the people you want to see in the bot!

What about monetization? 💰
- Plans: In the future it will be possible to support the project through donations to the card or Boosty 💳
- Optional: With the plugin system it will be possible to buy ready-made modules (referrals, custom limits, etc.) to monetize your copy of the bot. The basic version will remain free for personal use

P.S. If the bot saves you at least 10 minutes a day - I'm already happy. And by the way, if you find an analog - I will personally send you a virtual fortune cookie 🍪✨
