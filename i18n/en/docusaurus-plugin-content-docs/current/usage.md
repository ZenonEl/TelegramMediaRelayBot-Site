## 🌐 Adding Contacts — Create Your Mini Digital Network  

**TelegramMediaRelayBot** turns content sharing into a social ritual. Here's how to connect participants to your media circle:  

1. **🔄 Initiate Connection**  
   Send the `/start` command and click the *"Add Contact"* button in the menu.  
   → The bot will request a **unique link** from the user, like:  
   `1234ab56-cde-78fg-01hi-2j34k56790`  

2. **🔗 Exchange Identifiers**  
   - Your link can be found in the *"My Link"* section.  
   - Share it with future contacts — for example, via QR code or direct message.  

3. **🤝 Contact Confirmation**  
   - Paste the received link into the input field and send it to the bot.  
   - If everything is correct, you'll see a brief user profile.  

4. **⏳ Waiting for a Response**  
   - Your request will be sent to the recipient, who will receive a notification.  
   - Once they accept the invitation (via the *"Review Incoming Requests"* section).  
   - *And don't be afraid to use groups:* Contacts can and should be grouped into different categories: `Colleagues`, `Friends`, `Bird Lovers Society 🐦‍⬛️` — for targeted content distribution.

## 🚀 Downloading and Forwarding Content — Magic in Three Steps  

### 📥 Working with Links  
Simply send the bot a **link + description** in the format:  
```
https://youtu.be/your_awesome_video  
Check out this cosmic dance of the northern lights! 🌌 #nature #wow 
```  
→ The bot will handle the rest:  
1. Identify the platform (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and 50+ others).  
2. Download the content in optimal quality (configurable in the settings).  
3. Forward the video as needed and to whom it's needed. ✨  

### 🔄 Automatic Distribution  
- Your file will instantly be sent to all specified contacts in your list.  
- *Tip:* "Use hashtags in the description — you can later search for content via #cats or #work_not_wolf right in the chat history!  
Built-in hashtags also work, but custom ones are more convenient and personalized."
